# Boot from USB drive

SD cards were never intended for fast read-write access. Attaching a SSD drive via USB 3.0 port can [provide a dramatic increase to performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/raspberry-pi-4-ssd-test,39811.html).

The Raspberry Pi 4 B comes with two USB 3.0 ports, and you can pick up a portable SSD to USB 3.0 enclusure easily, eg

And buy a matching HDD/SSD drive to fit in the enclosure (even better if you can use an old one you have laying around unused).
