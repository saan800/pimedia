# PiMedia Build

None of this is original work, but more of a gathering of various sources and put into a logical step-by-step sequence. Hopefully some or all of this will be useful to others as well. If you have any updates or suggested additions please let me know or raise a PR.

Instructions are specifically for a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Windows 10 laptop, but should be similar for all OS.

## Build steps

1. [Setup Raspberry Pi with headless access](01_setup_headless_raspberry_pi.md)
2. [Boot from USB drive](02_boot_from_usb_drive.md)
